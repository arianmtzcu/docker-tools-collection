# Docker Tools Collection
This repository, "docker-tools-collection," was created with the goal of storing Docker subprojects for various tools that are especially useful for software development. Each subproject contains a Docker configuration that facilitates the setup and use of these tools in a development environment.

## Subprojects
The repository includes the following Docker subprojects:

1. **apache-kafka**: A Docker setup for Apache Kafka, a distributed streaming platform that can handle real-time data feeds.
   
2. **maven-rpm**: A Docker configuration for building RPM packages using Maven, providing a streamlined process for packaging and distribution.
   
3. **mongo-express**: A web-based MongoDB admin interface written in Node.js, deployed through Docker for easy management of MongoDB databases.
   
4. **mysql**: A Docker configuration for setting up a MySQL database server. This subproject includes configurations for two versions of MySQL:
   - `mysql:5.7`: The 5.7 version of MySQL, which is commonly used in legacy systems.
   - `mysql:8.0`: The latest stable version, offering enhanced features and performance improvements.
   
5. **rabbitmq**: A Docker setup for RabbitMQ, a message broker that enables applications to communicate via messaging protocols.
   
6. **watchtower**: A tool that automatically updates running Docker containers whenever a new image is available, ensuring that your services are always up-to-date.

## Purpose
The "docker-tools-collection" repository serves as a central place to store Docker configurations for various tools and technologies that are essential for modern software development workflows. Each subproject is designed to be easy to set up and integrate into your development environment, saving time and effort in managing these tools manually.
